* What is Duck

Duck is:
- A programming language
- A interactive evaluation environment
- A development environment
- A shell for the operating system
- A distributed system

** Duck as programming language

Main feature:
- 3 modes of operation:
  + interpreted
  + JIT compiled
  + AOT compiled
- Automatic memory management
- Memory safe (guaranteed no memory corruption)
- Exception management
- Native Sandboxing support (Execution environments)
- Hyper modular system with DB approach
  + each construct is a separate module at is interpreted/compiled separately
  + a system wide DB manages all constructs and their availability in
    the execution environments
- Data/Object/Concept/View paradigm
- Extended reflection
  + Basic reflection
  + Embedded source code (for interpreted mode)
  + Embedded documentation
- Native interface for C API (unsafe)
- Native persistance support with DB approach
- Native remote object access
- Terse pleasant syntax
- Decent performance
  + at maximum 4 times slower than C on average
  + at maximum 3 times higher memory consumption than C  on average
    (for >100MB global allocated memory)
